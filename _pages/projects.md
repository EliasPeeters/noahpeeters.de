In my free time, I always have some side-projects. Here you can find a list of projects I published in recent years. This is probably not always up to date. To find what I am currently working on, head over to my [GitHub Projects](https://github.com/NoahPeeters?tab=repositories) where I publish at least my programming stuff.
