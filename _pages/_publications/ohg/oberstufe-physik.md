## Goal

The goal of the paper is to give students an overview of all topics. This allows them to practice for the Abitur using this paper.

The paper does not have the goal to teach new students the topic and I discourage anyone from trying so as the explanations are not broad enough to completely understand the topic.

## Paper structure

The paper uses the same structure as my class in school. The paper contains explanations for each topic.
