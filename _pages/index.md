Hello there :wave: My name is Noah Peeters and I created this website because I had the domain and I thought it might be funny to have one. You can find the source code on my [GitHub account](https://github.com/noahPeeters/noahpeeters.de) in case you're interested in it.

I'll try to maintain a single point of contact for my digital life here. If you want to contact me (anonymously), feel free to use my [contact form](/contact) or one of the many platforms I use. You can find them on the left or in the *Follow* menu on mobile devices.

What else would you put on the main page of your website?

<div class="calendar">Github contributions chart.</div>
