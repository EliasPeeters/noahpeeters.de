Sadly, the LGBTQIA+ community is not yet fully accepted in many parts of the world. To create visibility in societies, all over the world different events and celebration dates have been created by and for the community.
Now, it is important that as many people as possible know about these days. Therefore, I created and maintain a calender subscription which can be imported or subscribed to in all modern calendar applications.

So please consider using a calendar subscription as the one I provided here -- even if you don't consider yourself as part of the community -- to remind yourself of all the awesome days in the year we can celebrate and the hate members of the LGBTQIA+ community have to withstand daily.

## Import

Importing the calendar is probably the easiest way to get started simply download the [ics-file](https://www.noahpeeters.de/assets/ics/pride.ics) and open it with your favorite calendar app. The downside of this approach is that you won't receive any future updates unless you manually delete all of the events from you calendar and redownload the most recent file. But we're in the year 2020 so you can simply subscribe to my calendar :tada:

## Subscription (Recommended)

The web address for the calendar subscription is [webcal://www.noahpeeters.de/assets/ics/pride.ics](webcal://www.noahpeeters.de/assets/ics/pride.ics).

Of course each calendar app has a slightly different UI to create a new subscription. Here is a list of some tutorials for some popular platforms/calendar apps so that you have no excuse for not subscribing:
