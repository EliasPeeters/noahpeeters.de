During my third semester of my bachelor's degree, I was the instructor of the tutorial for I154 "Discrete Mathematics 1".

The lecture covered the following topics:

* Foundations
    * Set theory
    * Propositional and predicate logic
    * Simple proof techniques
    * Mathematical induction
* Propositional calculus and boolean algebra
    * Logical connective
    * Propositions
    * Equivalence of propositions
    * Boolean functions
    * Canonical forms of boolean functions
* Combinatorial circuit
    * Implementation of boolean functions
    * Simplification of boolean functions
