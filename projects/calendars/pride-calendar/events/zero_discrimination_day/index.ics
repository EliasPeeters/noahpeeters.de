DESCRIPTION:#ZeroDiscrimination Day is observed to bring awareness that you can&rsquo;t get sick from interacting with people who have aids, that everybody should have access health care safely and live life fully with dignity. as per Michel Sidib√©, UNAIDS Executive Director. The day is also used to bring attention to acceptance of non-straight fellow humans and not marginalise, discriminate or act cruelly against them, yet to instruct oneself, e.g. the gender continuum.\nWikipedia
