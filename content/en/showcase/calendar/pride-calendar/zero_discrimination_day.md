#ZeroDiscrimination Day is observed to bring awareness that you can't get sick from interacting with people who have aids, that everybody should have access health care safely and live life fully with dignity. as per Michel Sidibé, UNAIDS Executive Director. The day is also used to bring attention to acceptance of non-straight fellow humans and not marginalise, discriminate or act cruelly against them, yet to instruct oneself, e.g. the gender continuum.
