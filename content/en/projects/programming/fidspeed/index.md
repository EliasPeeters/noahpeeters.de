FidSpeed is an iOS app to measure the speed of [Fidget Spinners](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fidget_spinner) which became very popular in 2017.

The free version of the app contains advertisements but is not available in all regions.

## How does it work?

FidSpeed uses the iPhone's slow-motion camera to capture the motion of Fidget Spinners in real-time. From each frame, the current angle of the Fidget Spinner is determined, which can be used to calculate the speed.
