Sadly, the LGBTQIA+ community is not yet fully accepted in many parts of the world. To create visibility in societies, different events and celebration dates have been created by and for the community all over the world.
Now, as many people as possible must know about these days. Therefore, I created and maintain a calendar subscription that can be imported or subscribed to in all modern calendar applications.

So please consider using a calendar subscription like the one I provided here -- even if you don't consider yourself as part of the community -- to remind yourself of all the awesome days in the year we can celebrate and the hate members of the LGBTQIA+ community have to withstand daily.

## Usage

There are three different ways to use the calendar. Choose the one you like the most. All of them contain the same information.

### Import

Importing the calendar is probably the easiest way to get started simply download the [ics-file](https://noahpeeters.de/projects/calendar/pride-calendar/index.ics) and open it with your favorite calendar app. The downside of this approach is that you won't receive any future updates unless you manually delete all of the events from your calendar and redownload the most recent file. But we're in the year 2020 so you can simply subscribe to the calendar :tada:

### Subscription (Recommended)

The web address for the calendar subscription is [webcal://noahpeeters.de/projects/calendar/pride-calendar/index.ics](webcal://noahpeeters.de/projects/calendar/pride-calendar/index.ics).

On most computers, you can simply click the link above and your default calendar app will ask you if you want to add a new subscription. If that is not the case, you have to manually copy the link and add it to your calendar. Of course, each calendar app has a slightly different UI to create a new subscription. Here is a list of some tutorials for some popular platforms/calendar apps so that you have no excuse for not subscribing:
 - [iCloud (Mac/iOS)](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202361)
 - [iPhone](https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/subscribe-to-calendars-on-iphone-ipad/)
 - [Google](https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/37100?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en)
 - [Outlook](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/import-or-subscribe-to-a-calendar-in-outlook-com-cff1429c-5af6-41ec-a5b4-74f2c278e98c)

### View Online

You can also view all of the events online. At the bottom of this page, all of the events in the calendar are listed and each event has it's own page with all the details.

## Support

When you find a mistake or know of a day that should be included in the calendar, please contact me and I will update the calendar as fast as possible!
